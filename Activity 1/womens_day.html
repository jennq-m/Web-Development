                                National Women's Day in the Philippines is celebrated every March 8 
                                as part of National Women's Month, which spans the entire month of March. 
                                It aims to recognize the achievements, struggles, and contributions of 
                                Filipino women in society, promoting gender equality and 
                                women's empowerment. Between 1909 and 1911, working women in the United States,
                                united under the National Women’s Trade Union League and other groups, rallied 
                                against low wages, insufficient protective legislation, and harsh working conditions.

                                <b>Republic Act 6949: National Women's Day </b> declares March 8th of every year as a working
                                special holiday. This Act, which is a consolidation of Senate Bill No. 1430 and House 
                                Bill No. 28379, was finally passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives 
                                on and April 4, 1990.

                                In the Philippines, a lot of various activities are held to commemorate the achievements 
                                Filipino women have attained, as well as reminding everyone of the struggles they have 
                                faced throughout the years. This celebration also enabled women to address rampant issues 
                                regarding women's empowerment and gender equality. This month-long celebration not just honors
                                the historical roots of women’s advocacy but also serves as a reminder of the ongoing journey
                                toward a just and inclusive society for all.
